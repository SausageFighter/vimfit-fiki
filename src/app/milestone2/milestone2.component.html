            <p>The idea validation is one of the most important stages when creating a start-up. We have questioned more
                than 230 persons using Google Forms questionnaires, aged between 14 and 50 years, males and females,
                certified trainers, and regular persons. We have collected their feedback, we had conversations beside
                the
                questionnaires, we listened to their stories and hopefully, we understood their necessities, pains, and
                desires.</p>

                    health issues and unhealthy habits. Now, none of the survey takers have any health issues though
                    most seem to rely on unhealthy habits to cope with stressful situations, which the pandemic has
                    aggravated in one way or another by making us more sedentary, consume chaotically, dealing with
                    weight gain, and having to deal with stress increase.

                    and few people still deal with lack of motivation and the thought of having to put in the time and
                    effort back into maintaining a clean diet and to get in shape.

                    Letâ€™s take a few examples and begin with powerlifting. There are many newcomers that come to the gym
                    after watching a few videos online about certain exercises, deadlifts and squats for example. They
                    begin to work out not knowing that they have poor form due to lack of building muscle to support
                    bone structure and they end up hurting themselves or even worse causing permanent injury. </div>

                    The same theory applies when it comes to dieting and healthy eating. People end up causing permanent
                    damage to their bodies trying to lose those extra pounds and after they finish the process, either
                    they end up back to binge eating due to psychological stress or starving himself or herself without
