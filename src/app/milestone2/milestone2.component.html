        <div class="text">
            <p>The idea validation is one of the most important stages when creating a start-up. We have questioned more
                than 230 persons using Google Forms questionnaires, aged between 14 and 50 years, males and females,
                certified trainers, and regular persons. We have collected their feedback, we had conversations beside
                the
                questionnaires, we listened to their stories and hopefully, we understood their necessities, pains, and
                desires.</p>
